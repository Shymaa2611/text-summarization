Logic is the science that explains what conditions must be fulfilled in order that a proposition may be proved, if it admits of proof. it is the science that explains how we may judge whether they are true, or false, or doubtful. absolute proof would require that a proposition should agree with all experience and with the systematic explanation of experience. but as no one hitherto has been able to frame such a philosophy, we must at present put up with something less than absolute proof.
