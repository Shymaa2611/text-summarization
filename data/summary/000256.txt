There are limitationsâ€”the king and queen cannot see their child until she is fourteen. The king decides to break this rule of the contract, and the princess dies. He is then forced to put her body in the church with a sentinel standing guard. However, finding a sentinel starts to become a challenge when those who volunteer disappear. A young smith who wishes to show his bravery is the first to last the night, and his drunken bravery earns him rewards.
