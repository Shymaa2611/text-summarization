chance was once believed to be a distinct power in the world, disturbing the regularity of Nature. but now it is admitted that every event in the world is due to some cause, if we can only trace the connection. the vast majority of events occurring about the same time are only related by Causation so remotely that the connection cannot be followed. if we can't trace the connection, we have to find some other ground for it than that of a spontaneous capricious force inherent in things.
